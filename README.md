# Challenge 1: The challenge is to find a way to use the API (http://worldclockapi.com/): It could be a simple page (you don't need to care about design or layout), some curl's examples or Postman's documentation.

Requirements:
●      You need to display the results on screen;
●      You need to use JavaScript or related programing language (i.e. NodeJS, ReactJS and others);
●      We must understand your code and use your API without having to ask you any questions. Our primary language is English so please use it on comments and documentation;
●      We’d like to see SOLID principles in your solution;
●      You don’t need to persist any data (but feel free to do it if you want);

-- To do the first Challenge, I decided to request the given API, and dynamically update the values by using the Json element's name as the HTML input's ids.


# Challenge 2: Create a Java class to print your name, nationality and biggest dream.

Requirements:
●      You need to display the results on screen;
●      You need to use Java;
●      You don’t need to persist any data (but feel free to do it if you want);

-- To do the second Challenge, I decided to create a class called 'Person', and a main class called 'ChallengeMain', then I simply defined a 'New Person' containing my data, and simply displayed the data usying 'JOptionPane'.
